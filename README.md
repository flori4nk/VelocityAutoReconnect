A simple automatic reconnection plugin for Velocity.

VelocityAutoReconnect is licensed under the GPLv3 license.

## Installation
1. Download [the latest release](https://ci.codemc.io/job/flori4nk/job/VelocityAutoReconnect/lastStableBuild/).
1. Upload it into the plugins directory of your instance of Velocity.
1. Restart the proxy to load the plugin and create the configuration files.
1. Configure the proxy, limbo server and plugin as outlined below.
1. Restart the proxy once again

## Configuration
### Proxy / Limbo
VelocityAutoReconnect does not implement a fallback server, only automatic reconnection from a fallback server to the previous server.
Therefore, a fallback server needs to be set up before the plugin can function. 
Using a Limbo server, such as [NanoLimbo](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nanolimbo.86198/), for this purpose is recommended.

After setting up the Limbo server and adding it to the servers section of velocity.toml, it needs to be added to the connection order.

Example using the regular try order:
```
[servers]
	...
	try = ["default", "limbo"]
```

Example using the forced hosts order:
```
[forced-hosts]
	"build.example.com" = ["build", "limbo"]
	"pvp.example.com" = ["pvp", "limbo"]
```
